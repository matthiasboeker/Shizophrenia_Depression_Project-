# Classification of Schizophrenia based onActivity Time Series using Hidden Markov Models




## Process
1. Explorative Analysis of the Actigraphy Time Series
	1.1 Data Structure  
	1.2 Stationarity and Autocorrelation  
	1.3  Analysis on the Time Series Sample Distribution
	1.4  Daily 24h structure of the Time Series
	1.5  Day and Night Structure of the Time Series
2. Hidden Markov Models to classify active/rest: parameters fitting
	2.1 Time in dependent Hidden Markov model
	2.2 Time dependent Hidden Markov model
	2.3 Time dependent Hidden Markov model with integrated covariate
3. Classification
	3.1 Baseline Classification of Literature Features
	3.2 Classification with time independent Hidden Markov model parameters
	3.3 Classification with time dependent Hidden Markov model parameters
	3.4 Classification with link coefficients of the time dependent Hidden Markov model with integrated covariate
